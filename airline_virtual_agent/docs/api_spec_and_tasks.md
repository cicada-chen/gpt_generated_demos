## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point for the application. It should initialize the VirtualAgent class and handle the Flask routes."),
    ("actions.py", "Defines the actions that the virtual agent can perform. It should include methods for handling inquiries, making bookings, checking flight status, and answering policy questions."),
    ("config.yml", "Contains the configuration settings for the Rasa NLU and dialogue management models."),
    ("credentials.yml", "Contains the credentials for the airline's booking and flight status systems."),
    ("endpoints.yml", "Defines the endpoints for the Rasa server and action server."),
    ("domain.yml", "Defines the chatbot's domain, including the intents, entities, slots, and actions."),
    ("data/nlu.md", "Contains the training data for the NLU model."),
    ("data/stories.md", "Contains the training data for the dialogue management model.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "config.yml",
    "credentials.yml",
    "endpoints.yml",
    "domain.yml",
    "data/nlu.md",
    "data/stories.md",
    "actions.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'actions.py' file contains the actions that the virtual agent can perform. These actions are defined as methods in the VirtualAgent class and are called by the main application in response to user input.

The 'config.yml', 'credentials.yml', and 'endpoints.yml' files contain configuration settings for the application. These files should be set up before starting the development of the main application and actions.

The 'domain.yml', 'data/nlu.md', and 'data/stories.md' files contain the training data for the Rasa NLU and dialogue management models. These files should be prepared before starting the development of the main application and actions.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
We need to clarify the exact requirements for the virtual agent's capabilities. For example, what types of inquiries should it be able to handle? What information is needed to make a booking? What flight status information should it be able to provide? What policy questions should it be able to answer?
